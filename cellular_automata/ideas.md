1. Gernalizing Growing Neural Cellular Automata

one aspect that disapointed me about the Growing Neural Cellular Automata article was its training. For each model they would only train it on a single image which pigeon holes the model. I wonder how you would go about making this model more genearl

2. applying Self-classifying MNIST model for image segmentation

3. implement the growing neural celluar automata but in a continuous space, lenia
  1. This could be applied to an other paper
